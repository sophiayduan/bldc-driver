# BLDC Motor controller and motor
There really isn't much practical use to make this, its better to buy one. I'm just making it to learn more about motors, pcbs and whatnot

The motor will use 3 Phase power in a Y configuration and is an outrunner

The driver will be a handheld device to easily test various bldcs
