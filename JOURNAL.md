# June 13th: Began my PCB and fixed my CAD model

**Total time spent: ~5h**

This is a continuation of my project from physics class. I originally cadded the motor with bad tolerances and poor alignment between the magnets and coils and had nothing to drive it.
So it was really a pile of 3D printed crap. 

Now I plan on completely fixing all the models and make a custom PCB to drive it (with PWM) 

Today I recadded the motor and worked on a basic schematic

^ a section view because I just learned how to do that recently and its super epic
This is just the start of the schematic, right now the driver design is super basic. It's a discrete driver meaning its not using any IC's. Later, once school is over i'll add some more unique and practical features to it.

Side note: My kiCAD wakatime kept on not working, and i don't think fusion 360 has wakatime ðŸ˜”
